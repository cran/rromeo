## Query Journal Data

**NOTE:** SHERPA/RoMEO data is released under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5 (CC BY-NC-SA 2.5) license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/). A suggestion of citation is included in `rromeo` via `citation("rromeo")`

The SHERPA/RoMEO database contains information on the archival policies of academic journals and publishers. Some journals let you archive a version of a submitted manuscript or book chapter (= preprint) before it's reviewed, some also let you archive the peer-reviewed but not formatted version (= postprint) and some even let you archive the peer-reviewed **and** formatted version of the manuscript (= pdf or publisher's version). The goal of `rromeo` is to make this database accessible through R.

### Query using ISSN

Let's try to access summary data using the ISSN of a journal:


```r
library(rromeo)

rr_journal_issn("1947-6264")
```

```
##                                                       title provided_issn      issn romeocolour preprint
## 1 A Critical Introduction to Media and Communication Theory     1947-6264 1947-6264      yellow      can
##    postprint        pdf pre_embargo post_embargo pdf_embargo
## 1 restricted restricted        <NA>    12 months   12 months
```

From this we see that the archival of the preprint is permitted while some restrictions apply for both postprint and pdf version of the manuscript. The restrictions are visible in the `*_embargo` field: the authors have to wait 12 months after publication before archiving postprint and formatted manuscript.

**Nota Bene**: the `rr_journal_issn()` function can use either the paper edition ISSN of the journal or the ISSN of the electronic version of the journal (e-ISSN or ESSN) which may differ


### Query by Journal Title

We can also search journal by names using `rr_journal_find()` the first argument `name` is the string to look for and the second argument `qtype` defines the way to match. If we want to look at journals that have the word `Biostatistics` in their title we can use the following code:


```r
rr_journal_find("Biostatistics", qtype = "contains")
```

```
## 17 journals match your query terms.
```

```
## Only titles and ISSNs of journals returned. Get more information using `rr_journal_name()`
```

```

```

`rr_journal_find()` will only return the list of titles and ISSN.
You can then use this list to select the exact journal you are looking for (in
this case, it is recommended to use the ISSN).
Alternatively, you may want to get data for all those journals. To achieve this,
you need to use the function `rr_journal_name()` which uses a similar syntax to `rr_journal_find()`:


```r
res <- rr_journal_name("Biostatistics", qtype = "contains")
```

```
## 17 journals match your query terms.
```

```
## Recursively fetching data from each journal. This may take some time...
```

```r
tail(res, 3)
```

```
##                                           title provided_issn      issn romeocolour preprint  postprint

## 16 unclear        <NA>    12 months        <NA>
```
The query may run for longer but it gives you all the information on all returned journals.

You can also use other type of name matching with other options for `qtype`, for example when `qtype = "starts"` the query string have to begin the title of the journal:


```r
rr_journal_name("Biostatistics", qtype = "starts")
```

```
## 3 journals match your query terms.
```

```
## Recursively fetching data from each journal. This may take some time...
```

```
##                                              title provided_issn      issn romeocolour preprint

```

While using `qtype = exact` the title of the journal should match exactly the used string:


```r
rr_journal_name("Biostatistics", qtype = "exact")
```

```
##           title provided_issn      issn romeocolour preprint postprint    pdf pre_embargo post_embargo

##   pdf_embargo
## 1        <NA>
```


## Query Publisher Data

Not only can `rromeo` query journals archival policies but it can do the same for publishers. Indeed the SHERPA/RoMEO database contains much information on publishers' policies, with many ways to retrieve the information.

### Query by Publisher's Name

With `rr_publisher_name()` you can query publishers' information using the name of the publishers. The first argument `name` is the string to match publisher's names the second argument `qtype` gives the type of matching:


```r
rr_publisher_name(name = "Oxford", qtype = "all")
```

```
##   romeoid                                                       publisher alias romeocolour preprint

## 3        can     can
## 4 restricted unclear
## 5        can     can
```

When `qtype = "all"` the publishers' names should contain all the words, in any order, included in provided string:

```r
rr_publisher_name(name = "Oxford University", qtype = "all")
```

```
##   romeoid                                                       publisher alias romeocolour preprint
## 1    2632                                       Oxford Brookes University  <NA>        blue   cannot

## 2        can     can
## 3 restricted unclear
## 4        can     can
```

While when `qtype = "exact"` the publishers' names should contain all the words in the same order as provided in the string:

```r
rr_publisher_name(name = "Oxford University", qtype = "exact")
```

```
##   romeoid                                 publisher alias romeocolour preprint  postprint     pdf
## 1     986 Oxford University Anthropological Society  <NA>       green      can        can     can
## 2      55                   Oxford University Press   OUP      yellow      can restricted unclear
```

Finally, when `qtype = "any"` publishers' names can contain any words of the provided string.


### Query by RoMEO's ID

The first column of publishers' policies data frame returned by `rromeo` is named `romeoid` it corresponds to the identifier used by SHERPA/RoMEO to identify publishers in a unique way:


```r
rr_publisher_id(id = 55)
```

```
##   romeoid               publisher alias romeocolour preprint  postprint     pdf
## 1      55 Oxford University Press   OUP      yellow      can restricted unclear
```


### Query by Country or Region

You can also query publishers information based on the country they are in using their two-letters ISO codes (see `?rr_publisher_country` for more information):


```r
rr_publisher_country(country = "IR")
```

```

### Query by RoMEO colour

RoMEO assigns a colour depending on the different policies of publishers.

  | RoMEO colour | Archiving policy                                        |
  |:-------------|:--------------------------------------------------------|
  | `green`      | can archive preprint, postprint and publisher's version |
  | `blue`       | can archive postprint **or** publisher's version        |
  | `yellow`     | can archive preprint                                    |
  | `white`      | archiving not formally supported                        |

(Table taken from <http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/definitions.php#colours>)

You can query journals using this classification with the function `rr_romeo_colour()`:


```r
rr_romeo_colour(romeo_colour = "green")
```

In this example vignette we do not run the query because it can run for quite long as it returns the policies of all publishers of the given colour (you can see the numbers of publishers in each category in the following web page <http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/statistics.php?la=en&fIDnum=|&mode=simple>).


## Setting up an API key

SHERPA/RoMEO lets you make 500 queries per day per IP address for free. If you get past this limit you will get the following error:
```
You have exceeded the free use limit of 500 requests per day. To go beyond this limit you should register for a free API key available at http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/apiregistry.php
```
We encourage you to register for a **free** API key at the above-mentioned address.

To provide your API key to `rromeo` you can:
1. provide it as a character string as the `key` arguments of `rromeo` functions as `rr_*(..., key = "my_key_as_a_string")`, we **do not recommend** this method as your API key will be available from your history;
1. you can define the variable `SHERPAROMEO_KEY` in an `.Renviron` file in your working directory, the file should contain the following line
  `SHERPAROMEO_KEY=my_key_without_quotes`;
1. you can also define the variable `SHERPAROMEO_KEY` in an `.Rprofile` file in your working directory, the file should contain the following line
  `SHERPAROMEO_KEY="my_key_with_quotes"`.

## Visualization Example

`rromeo` can be quite useful in bibliometric studies to report on archival policies. For example, we can now have a quick visual overview of the policies of journals in a given field from the results obtained in a query:


```r
library(ggplot2)
theme_set(theme_minimal())

stacked_res <- stack(res[, 4:6])
ggplot(stacked_res, aes(x = ind, fill = values)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = NULL,
       subtitle = "Archiving Policies of Journals with 'Biostatistics' in their title")
```

![plot of chunk bar_graph](bar_graph-1.png)


```r
ggplot(res, aes(x = "a", fill = romeocolour)) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_polar("y") +
  labs(x = NULL,
       subtitle = "RoMEO colours of Journals with 'Biostatistics' in their title")
```
